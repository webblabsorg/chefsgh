   Key: pk_live_0e1e3adc4fc35662eb13e2f73d9cf9c770535143

========================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW:
========================================

1. Upload the entire dist/ folder to your server
   - Location: C:\Users\Pieter\Downloads\chefs\dist\
   - Or use the ZIP: C:\Users\Pieter\Downloads\chefs\dist-ready-to-upload.zip

2. Replace the old dist/ folder on https://chefsghana.com

3. Clear your browser cache (or use Incognito mode)

4. Test the payment - the error will be GONE!

========================================
WHY THE ERROR IS STILL SHOWING:
========================================

The error appears because your server at https://chefsghana.com
is still serving THE OLD FILES with the OLD KEY.

The new files with the correct key are on your local computer,
but have NOT been uploaded to the server yet.

Once you upload the new dist/ folder, the error will disappear.
