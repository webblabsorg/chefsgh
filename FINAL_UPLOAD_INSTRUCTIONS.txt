??  YOU UPLOADED THE WRONG dist FOLDER BEFORE! ??

The console shows you uploaded files with 'index-BDNO4ydo.js'
Those are OLD files that still try to connect to Supabase!

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

? THE CORRECT FILE TO UPLOAD:

   Location: C:\Users\Pieter\Downloads\UPLOAD_THIS_DIST_FOLDER.zip
   
   This ZIP contains:
   - index.html with Paystack key: pk_live_0e1e3adc...
   - index-CGT38ikO.js (NEW - correct file!)
   - index-n2KG4E_m.css
